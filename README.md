# Openpose-docker (CPU-only)

This repo contains a Dockerfile for [openpose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose), building the CPU-only version. Right now it's still a work in progress (i.e., it doesn't work). The dockerfile is built on the work by [ruffsl](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/pull/12). Right now it just builds Openpose v1.3.0.
